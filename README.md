We are living in digital age, where sharing knowledge and communication is been vital for running a business or maintaining a good relationship. I tried to develop a chat application where a user can create and 
communicate on a topic seamlessly. User can create a topic or he/she can add an existing topic to his/her list. The web app is fully responsive, you can use it on Mobile/Laptop/Desktop, anywhere.

Welcome! we hope you enjoy the site as much as we enjoyed making it.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
